# ShaderSlides
Shader slide / editor for Shader workshop based on thebookofshaders.com editor!

## BUGS
* ~~Styling horizontal scrollbar bug~~
* ~~ExportIcon doesnt work anymore after style fix~~
  * ~~Lets just add the wanted export links ourselves~~
* ~~Solution canvas not positioned right~~
* Not sure where syntax error console logs are coming from, everything working

## TODO
* ☻♥☺ STYLING ☻♥☺
 * Sections/Editors not intersecting
* Section paging
* Declaration of Slides
* Auto-save code + clear save?
* ~~Tab-able code for solution~~
* Reference book of shaders clearly
* Add useful export links from exporticon

## Low priority
* Load solution automatic if file + "_solution_" exists
* Highlight sections by lowering opacity of other sections
